## Subject: Appeal for Account Reinstatement - Veilo Wallet

Dear Chrome Web Store Review Team,

I am writing to appeal the suspension of my publisher account and request the opportunity to resubmit my extension, "Veilo Wallet."

I have carefully reviewed the Chrome Web Store policies and made significant changes to ensure full compliance. I would also like to bring to your attention that a **directly comparable extension has been approved** on the Chrome Web Store, which I believe demonstrates that my extension's functionality is policy-compliant.

## Approved Comparable Extension: Hush Wallet

**Hush Wallet** (published by hush.so) is currently live on the Chrome Web Store with the following features:

- "Auto-shielding SOL: All SOL that flows through Hush is put in a private pool with other users funds"
- "Private dApp connections"
- "Private Swapping: Swap exclusively using shielded funds"
- "Break onchain links"
- "Proxy routing to prevent IP leakage"

**Veilo Wallet provides equivalent functionality** using the same technical approach (privacy pools and wallet management). If Hush Wallet meets Chrome Web Store policies, Veilo Wallet should as well.

## What Veilo Wallet Does

Veilo is a **privacy-focused Solana wallet** that helps users manage their crypto securely:

- **Smart Wallet Management:** Automatically manages wallets behind the scenes to enhance privacy
- **Private dApp Connections:** Create fresh wallets for connecting to dApps
- **Veilo Balance:** Pool funds with other users for enhanced privacy
- **Private Transfers:** Send crypto to other users privately using usernames
- **Local Encryption:** All keys encrypted with AES-256 on your device

This is **functionally identical** to Hush Wallet, which is currently approved.

## Changes Made

I have made the following improvements to ensure compliance:

### 1. Clear "Beta" Designation

- Added beta disclaimer to indicate the software is in development
- Clear warnings about cryptocurrency risks

### 2. Enhanced Privacy Policy

- Detailed explanation of what data is collected (minimal)
- Clear explanation of what data is NOT collected
- Full justification for all requested permissions

### 3. Improved Documentation

- Clear description of all features
- Transparent explanation of how privacy features work
- Open source code available for review

## Compliance with Chrome Web Store Policies

### Single Purpose

Veilo has ONE clear purpose: Enable users to securely and privately manage Solana cryptocurrency and interact with dApps.

### No Deceptive Behavior

- No misleading claims about functionality
- Clear documentation of all features
- Open source code available for review

### User Data Protection

- All sensitive data encrypted locally
- No browsing data collected
- Privacy by design

### Precedent

- **Hush Wallet is approved** with identical privacy pool functionality
- Our extension follows the same technical and policy approach

## Request

I respectfully request:

1. Reinstatement of my developer account
2. The opportunity to submit the updated, compliant version of Veilo
3. Review in light of the approved precedent (Hush Wallet)

I am committed to full compliance with Chrome Web Store policies. The approval of Hush Wallet demonstrates that privacy-focused Solana wallets with pooling features are acceptable on the Chrome Web Store.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
Developer, Veilo Wallet
