# Privacy Policy for Veilo

Veilo is a browser-based crypto wallet designed to keep your on-chain Solana activity private. Your privacy and security are important to us, and this policy explains how Veilo handles data and interacts with third-party services.

## 1. Data Handling

All core wallet functions, including key management and transaction signing, run locally in your browser. Veilo does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or wallet data to external servers.

## 2. Third-Party Services

To provide key functionality, Veilo integrates with the following trusted services:

- **Jupiter** – used for token swaps
- **Veilo Layer** – used for privacy-preserving transactions

Each of these services operates independently and may have their own privacy practices. We recommend reviewing their respective privacy policies before using those features.

## 3. Local Operation

All other operations, including wallet management and transaction generation, occur entirely on your device. Your private keys and data never leave your browser.

## 4. Liability

Veilo is provided "as is," without any warranties or guarantees. By using the wallet, you acknowledge that we are not liable for any loss of funds, data, or damages resulting from your use of the extension, third-party integrations, or any unexpected failures.
